# Classification

![narrator_knowledge_colour](narrator_knowledge_colour.png)

- `Unsure`

  - This is the default classification. Some nodes may remain Unsure after a run of the classification.

  - There is always a chance that Narrator cannot classify successfully. The classification algorithm overall is a best effort solution that tries to mimic how a human would classify these roughly based on things like annotations provided by the ATP, how the formulas are linked together. While we try to reduece these cases, we note we do not have a complete algorithm for classifying the role of each formula in the context of attack derivation.

- `Axiom`

  - These are universally quantified formulas which declare the basic properties of function symbols, such as the XOR axioms

- `InitialKnowledge`

  - This is the classification for public variables

- `Rewriting`

  - These are rules derived from axioms

- `Knowledge`

  - These are knowledge derived from `InitialKnowledge`, `ProtocolStep`, or other `Knowledge`, using `Axiom`, `RewritingRule`, or `InteractiveProtocolStep`

- `Goal`

  - This is the final goal the attacker attempts to achieve, a direct translation of the query, say if the query is `query attacker(objective)`, then `Goal` would be `attacker(objective)`

- `NegatedGoal`

  - This is the negated version of `Goal`. The negation is part of FOL resolution.

  - Nodes of this category normally disappear after goal rewriting procedure

- `Contradiction`

  - This is the `$false` symbol (‚ä•), at the bottom of the refutation proof

  - Nodes of this category normally disappear after goal rewriting procedure

- `ProtocolStep`

  - These are unconditional steps - steps which occur regardless of attacker's interaction

- `InteractiveProtocolStep`

  - These are output steps which depend on a previous input or some form of predicate

- `Alias`

  - These are nodes generated by branching by Vampire's AVATAR architecture of the form `name <=> formula`
